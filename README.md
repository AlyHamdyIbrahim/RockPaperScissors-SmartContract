# RockPaperScissors-SmartContract

A tie between two participants happened in a competition, and a mechanism is needed to distribute the reward. The two participants agreed to use a rock-paper-scissors game to decide whether one of them should take the reward, or distribute it equally among them. However, the participants were not at the same place to run this.
Write a smart contract that would enable the participants to run the protocol. Assume that the two participants have known addresses in advance, and that the contest manager is the creator of the contract. The contract creator will deposit the reward to the contract at the beginning.
